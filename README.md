# -100DaysOfCode
I'm challenging myself to learn code for 100 days.

I'm challenging myself to learn code for 100 days. I'm on a journey to build a mobile app with Flutter. I did try Java but a lot of the concepts were very hard for me. I have now made the switch to flutter and my journey has no longer stopped, it's moving forward to better things. I have high hopes for this app. I'm going to build small and grow it as I learn new things.

Feel free to use the code I come up with, let me know if it's helped you.
